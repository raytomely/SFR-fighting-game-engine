THE DEAL

After working on this game for so long, I decided to release as complete a
game I could, considering the limitations of the engine.  I have also
decided to forego any hidden character unlocking system and have all
characters playable from the start.  I'll be the first to admit that this
game is not as good as it should be, or that it even comes close to mugen,
but I have worked very hard on this game and I think it's worth a look.  It
is still in the beta stages and I have not added many endings or story.
That's actually been the hardest part of making this game.  So I'll save them
for later.

D,F,D,F,Hard Kick       Violent Dragon (level 2)
D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      True Dragon Punch (level 3)

- My take on "Satsui Hado No Ryu".  He hasn't been overcome by dark power.
He's just a big jerk :).  The True Dragon Punch is the one from SFA3, w/o
the distance limitations.

D,B,D,B,Hard Kick       Heaven Kick (level 2)

- No, not one of those types of edited characters, the X means that I have
her the SFA/X-Men type attacks.  This one is in the leggers outfit.

SUPER ARTS
D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      Atomic Piledriver (level 2)

- Only one super, but it does a ton of damage.  As a wrestling fan, I felt
the need to add a lot of grappler characters :).


BALROG              
B,F,Punch               Dash Straight

D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      Energy Dragon Punch (level 3)

- Due to jealousy, Ken dyes his outfit and learns some fancy moves.  The
sprites are from SSF2T.  The New Dragon Punch (Shinshoken) is pretty much the
Shinryuken without a spiral.  The Energy Dragon Punch (Hadoshoryuken) is
loosely based on an attack he used from the Street Fighter V anime series.


SAGAT               
D,F,Punch               High Tiger Shot

P1,P1,F,P3,K1           Instant Hell Taunt (level 3)

- My "Evil" character parodies catch up to Dan.  Despite the fact he is now
evil, he's still the same old Dan we all know and love.  He puts his own
twist on his versions of the Teleport and Instant Hell Murder.

SUPER ARTS
D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      True Shining Punch (level 2)

- The sprites are from SSF2T.  Actually, this is the same file from SFranma1.
I tried to get the SFA3 sprites, but screwed up, and didn't realize why
until just a couple of days ago (I saved the files as JPG instead of GIF).


ADON

SUPER ARTS
D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      Rainbow Hip Rush (level 2)
D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      New Heavenly Dynamite (level 2)

moves the same, except for the New Heavenly Dynamite, which ends with an
automatic 450 splash.

D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      Aura Soul Throw (level 2)
D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      Aura Soul Spark (level 2)

- My all time favorite SFA series character.  I couldn't make the Soul
Reflect moves....reflect.  They just cancel projectiles.  The Soul Throw
is a little buggy too.  I did add a little effect to the Aura Soul Throw
though.


SAKURA   
D,F,Punch               Fireball (Can hold for 1 more level on Medium Punch,
                                  2 levels on Hard)

SUPER ARTS
D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      Yamamoto Special 78 (level 2)

- Yes, the Firepro games are represented in a fighter.  Morio Smith is
actually from Super Fire Pro Special, the game made just before Super Fire
Pro X.  There was a good story mode, where you played as Morio and went
through various federations, and ended up wrestling the boss.  An evil
looking Ric Flair (I'm serious!).  This was pretty much the precursor to the
story mode in FPG.

B,F,B,F,Hard Kick       Stone Cold Stunner (level 2)

- From the Edit Ranking mode in Firepro G.  I couldn't get her "real" name,
so I used the generic name from the FPG faqs out there.  I based her moves
on the American style moveset she used in the edit ranking.

SUPER ARTS
D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      Rapid Roaring Elbow (level 2)
B,F,B,F,Hard Punch      Diamond Dust (level 2)

- Mostly an inside joke between me and a friend.  We were watching this
Japanese wrestling tape, and I was joking around that it would make a good
fighting game, and it evolved into this.  In hindsight, I don't think adding
these characters came out as good as I thought (actually pretty much
everything I ever do doesn't come out as good as I thought :P).

- I made 2 bad versions of Ako and Bko before, then majere made them for
Mugen.  I asked for permission, and got the go-ahead.  I couldn't have
done any better with these edits.  And it was great to finally add these

B,F,B,F,Hard Kick               Mecha Jackhammer Rush (level 2)

- Asa is one of Bko's assistants in the Project Ako movies.  I used the
sprite from the Bko character and edited it into the mecha from the old
arcade game Captain Commando.  BTW I think Kaizoe means second or assistant,
and I found that out on a website whose name escapes me.

- Now my "tributes".  When SFA first came out, there was this guy who I
always played against in the college arcade.  Once, as a favor, he taped a
bunch of anime movies for me, and the rest of the semester we kept making
jokes about it.  One was Fist of the North Star, which has to be one of
the most fucked up movies I have ever seen.  Then I played the NES
version of the game, and realized how violent that version was :).  However
in SFranma 2, he has to stop his Fist of the North Star before the final
deadly strike, because killing can get you disqualified.  Of course the anime
that we really made fun of was...

D,F,D,F,Hard Punch      Cool Hunting 13 (level 2)
D,B,D,B,Hard Punch      Sniper (level 3)

- What can I say.  I never knew those 2 old NES games would lead to this.
Golgo 13: The Professional.  Let's see.  Those cool characters like Snake,
Gold and Silver.  The millionare was shocked that Snake wanted his wife as
payment, then said okay a second later (you want a reciept for that?).  The
time where Golgo puts a grenade in an assasians throat, which cleanly
decapitates him.  Those cutting-edge computer graphics.  The fact that
anyone who comes within close contact with Golgo 13 pretty much dies (there
should've been a scene where Duke Togo was walking down the street on a
daily errand like shopping for food, and everyone's running away from him.
"No!  Stay away from me").  This movie was the subject of many laughs in
the college arcade.

- From Street Combat, aka the mangled American version of Ranma 1/2:
Neighborhood Combat.  This was what Ranma was changed into.  A weak
character, but not likeable like Dan.


KUNG FU THOMAS
No special moves or super arts, but can chain all his normal attacks.
Throw w/ P2/P3/K2/K3    Judo Hug

with.

- Now that the NWO is back, and Hogan is now a face again this character
isn't as dated.  My NWO parody from SFranma 1, he has more outside
interference, a no sell, and the big legdrop, brother.

GAME BUGS/OTHER NOTES
---------------------
- Match resets when ypu press Down of the keypad
- All attackes normally D,U or another varaitaion have their direction
  changed.  It's hard to do a D,U motion on a computer.
- Some of the special throws screw up at times.
- In a normal match when you throw, you get credit for winning 2 matches
- Some attacks marked as unblockable can hit through throws
- All "alternate forms" of characters have to be added in as separate
  characters
- I haven't written in endings yet.  I may not.  I suck at writing :P.
