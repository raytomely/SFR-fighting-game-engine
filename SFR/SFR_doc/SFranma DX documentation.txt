TO PLAY TYPE "SFRANMA"

THE DEAL

I consider this an alternate sequel to SFranma.  With SFranma 2, I was working
on it assuming that there would be improvements made to the engine, and put
too much in.  However with this game, I worked on it, considering the
limitations of the engine (like I did with M Fighter), and the final
product feels more like a complete game than a work in progress.

I went for 3 groups of characters Street Fighter, Capcom, and SNK.  I was
mostly inspired by the copy of Capcom vs. Snk that I got for $19.99, as well
as the fact that Terry and Andy were characters in the original Korean SFibm
program in the place of Balrog and Vega.  The SNK gang in this game to me
is an expansion of that idea.  Not to mention that I had a ton of SNK
characters from the past that were just laying around.  Finally, I kept
forgetting, Fatal Fury is also one of my favorite anime series.

Something I'd like to note is that I added 2 "crossover" characters for
each group.  One is a character from another video game/anime from the same
company (Morrigan, Fio Germi, Lum) and the other is a character from another
videogame/anime from a different time (Linn Kurosawa, Kuroko, Inuyasha).
This was initially inspired by the fact that I also got the PSX Inuyasha for
$19.99 :).

(Last minute note: I didn't know that Fio and Mr. Karate were going to
be in SNK vs Capcom Chaos when I made them, honest :) )

Also new for the game, a sorta more cohesive storyline!!!!!

* Back to basics.  For some of the characters, I decided to revamp them back
to what I call "CE Plus".  The basis for their moveset is SF2:Champion Edition
with the addition of one super.  This is mostly based on the EX characters in
CvS1.  Llinrac did note that all the evil characters were getting to be too
much, even though it was done mostly in parody :).

GAME BUGS/OTHER NOTES
---------------------
- No more alternate forms of characters.  I only added one form for each
  character that had multiple ones in the past (i.e. Ranma, Genma, etc)
- Not to say that I forgot about the alternate forms.  If I make a sequel
  to this game and I have an  engine that will allow me to add multiple
  forms, I will add them.  Also there are still characters that can change
  form in mid play (M.Bison, Hinako).
- On a related note, there are 2 characters with a hidden level 3 super art
  that will transform them into another form.

- Match resets when ypu press Down of the keypad
- All attacks normally D,U or another varaitaion have their direction
  changed.  It's hard to do a D,U motion on a computer.
- Some of the special throws screw up at times.
- In a normal match when you throw, you get credit for winning 2 matches
- Some attacks marked as unblockable can hit through throws
