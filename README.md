This is the lost SFR fighting game engine, made by Truefenix in the late 90s.

it was made for the DOS operating system, 

luckily I found its source code inside SFRanma 2' s folder, and I decided to port it to modern operating systems.

I ported it using the SDL cross-platform library, so porting it to another platform should be easy.

It should be noted that the source code I found did not match the compiled DOS version, 

it was an inferior version and was missing a lot of things.

I did my best to match the compiled DOS version and add what was missing.

I have also added new things to improve the gameplay, you can configure those in the sfrconfig.cfg file.

among these new features that I added, there is a debug mode that 

is very useful when testing new fighters that you want to add to the engine or when you are making a new fighter.

so here is it, enjoy making your own fighting game.
